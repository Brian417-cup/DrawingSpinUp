# Step 0: Contour Removal
## Data and Pretrained Models
You can download our processed testing images (a tiny subset of [Amateur Drawings Dataset](https://github.com/facebookresearch/AnimatedDrawings)) from [here](https://portland-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/jzhou67-c_my_cityu_edu_hk/EXwpR2S7kYlMnFIFFdYGdOYBSNUfu9tA-s2c50XfWaCTuA?e=jSGv5V) and pretrained contour removal models from [here](https://portland-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/jzhou67-c_my_cityu_edu_hk/Ed6BaAAWgIhGqIMjaju_v4kB_K-DIFGu1bQ7zM3CbQMrTw?e=KaltGi).
## Training & Testing
We use [LaMa](https://github.com/advimman/lama) as backbone to prediction the contour regions. 
For environment setup and training, you can refer to the original repo.
Here we only focus on testing.
